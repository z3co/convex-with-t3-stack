# Integrating T3 Stack with Convex: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a T3 Stack project and integrating it with Convex for your backend needs.

## 1. Setting Up Your T3 Stack Project

Begin by creating a new T3 App project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pnpm create t3-app@latest my-t3-convex-app
```

When prompted, select the following options for your project configuration:

- **TypeScript:** Yes
- **ESLint:** Yes
- **Tailwind CSS:** Yes
- **tRPC:** No (Convex will primarily handle your backend logic, making tRPC optional unless specifically desired.)
- **NextAuth.js:** No (Convex provides its own authentication system.)
- **Prisma or Drizzle:** No
- **_init projects_:** Yes

This will initialize your T3 Stack project with the chosen configuration.

## 2. Installing Convex Dependencies

Navigate into your newly created project directory and install the necessary Convex packages:

```bash
cd my-t3-convex-app
pnpm add convex
pnpm add -D npm-run-all2
```

## 3. Updating `package.json` Scripts

Open your `package.json` file in your code editor. Add or update the following scripts to enable concurrent development for your frontend and backend:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm-run-all --parallel dev:backend dev:frontend",
    "dev:frontend": "next dev --turbo",
    "dev:backend": "convex dev",
    "predev": "convex dev --until-success"
  }
}
```

## 4. Initializing Your Convex Project

In your terminal, run the `predev` script to initialize your Convex project:

```bash
pnpm run predev
```

You will be prompted to create a new project. Choose to create a new project and accept the default name. Follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your Convex account if you haven't already.

## 5. Configuring `t3-env` for Convex URL

Open the `src/env.js` file in your code editor and update it to include the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` environment variable. This ensures your application can connect to your Convex deployment.

Modify the `client` and `runtimeEnv` sections as follows:

```javascript
// Under client add NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
client: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: z.string().min(2).url(),
},
// and add it to the runtimeEnv
runtimeEnv: {
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL,
},
```

## 6. Configuring the Convex Client Provider

Create a new file named `src/app/convex-client-provider.tsx` with the following content. This component will provide the Convex client instance to your React application.

```typescriptreact
"use client";

import { env } from "~/env";
import { ConvexReactClient, ConvexProvider } from "convex/react";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL);

export default function ConvexClientProvider({
  children,
}: {
  children: ReactNode;
}) {
  return <ConvexProvider client={convex}> {children} </ConvexProvider>;
}
```

## 7. Wrapping Your Application with `ConvexProvider`

Finally, modify your `src/app/layout.tsx` file to wrap your application's `children` with the `ConvexClientProvider`. This makes the Convex client accessible throughout your application.

```typescriptreact
import ConvexClientProvider from "./convex-client-provider";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" className={`${geist.variable}`}>
      <body>
        <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Congratulations!

You have successfully set up your T3 App project with Convex. Remember to run your development server using `pnpm run dev` to start both your frontend and backend Convex processes while developing.
